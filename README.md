# How does a For loop work? 

## Method 1 ==>
      1. Control falls into the for loop. Initialization is done
      2. The flow jumps to Condition
      3. Condition is tested. 
      4. If the Condition yields true, the flow goes into the Body
      5. If the Condition yields false, the flow goes outside the loop
      6. The statements inside the body of the loop get executed.
      7. The flow goes to the Updation
      8. Updation takes place and the flow goes to Step 3 again
      9. The for loop has ended and the flow has gone outside.

## Method 2 ==>
      1. Program starts.
      
      2. i is initialized with value 1.
      
      3. Condition is checked. 1 <= 5 yields true.
      
              1. “Hello World” gets printed 1st time.
              2. Updation is done. Now i = 2.

              
      4. Condition is checked. 2 <= 5 yields true.
      
              1. “Hello World” gets printed 2nd time.
              2. Updation is done. Now i = 3.

              
      5. Condition is checked. 3 <= 5 yields true.
      
             1. “Hello World” gets printed 3rd time
             2. Updation is done. Now i = 4.

             
      6. Condition is checked. 4 <= 5 yields true.
      
            1. “Hello World” gets printed 4th time
            2. Updation is done. Now i = 5.

            
      7. Condition is checked. 5 <= 5 yields true.
      
            1. “Hello World” gets printed 5th time
            2. Updation is done. Now i = 6.

            
      8. Condition is checked. 6 <= 5 yields false.
      
      9. Flow goes outside the loop. Program terminates.
