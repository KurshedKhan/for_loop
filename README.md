# How does a For loop work? 

## Method 1==>
      1. Control falls into the for loop. Initialization is done
      2. The flow jumps to Condition
      3. Condition is tested. 
      4. If the Condition yields true, the flow goes into the Body
      5. If the Condition yields false, the flow goes outside the loop
      6. The statements inside the body of the loop get executed.
      7. The flow goes to the Updation
      8. Updation takes place and the flow goes to Step 3 again
      9. The for loop has ended and the flow has gone outside.
